 Atreus reacted touch struck summer lightning . 
 “ away ! ” bellowed , recoiling force crashed low wooden bench , split forehead corner table . 
 Iula started away , losing balance . 
 Atreus covered face hand , tried regain footing composure . backed space open door , brought knees like wall rest world . “ touch , touch , touch , ” repeated , breath .

 folded arms tightly chest , sobbing gently , grasping fabric smock , sank sit opposite floor . sat time . Iula said goodly , watching sunlight window slowly gray tiles , thinking rheumatic ache joints , chill toes . 
 Eventually , Atreus calmed let head sink little , wiped eyes sleeves cleared throat .

 Malcolm Graves Twisted Fate ( unwisely ) poked heads cover , looking different monocular eye newfound opponent . steely gaze , muscular figure , mean - looking weapon clearly intended skewer sea serpents . second recognition passed . seconds . , reason , . 
 “ Bombolini ? ” Graves asked . 
 “ Malcolm ? ” Bombolini asked . “ Malcolm Graves ? ? ... robbing ? ” 
 Graves let sigh relief , relaxing shoulders . dumb fish . dumb fish friend . 
 “ robbing . robbing guy hired , ” Graves explained . “ think hired , . makes doin’ morally sound . ”

 “ worst , ” retorted Graves . 
 “ jewel , ” Fate corrected . “ Ended glass . ” 
 “ Nah , right , ” Graves said . “ . ”

 years prior , Bombolini unappreciated member Graves & Fate crime duo pulled small jobs bad pay , posters somewhat ... unfortunately worded . 
 “ men ( mean ) anybody ( mean anybody ) right price ( price ) , ” leaflets , , addition Bombolini complete erasure group , led number avoidable miscommunications prospective clientele . thanks Bilgewater rich tradition violent escalation , mishaps tended end bloodshed minor dock explosions — ironically drawing attention upstart criminals popular mercenary outfit . 
 leaflets remained unchanged years , young Bombolini deeply bitter . eventually portion group earnings buy modest schooner , retire criminality , start solo wreck - diving operation Blue Flame Isles paid better robbery coincidentally bill sort pirate flesh carnival bar flyers . coincidentally , success tends draw eyes , eyes eventually hired Malcolm Graves Twisted Fate rob companion dive site near Buhru ruin . Lacking moral fiber whatsoever , pair immediately accepted . robbery instantly led small oil fire , large oil fire , bloodshed followed minor schooner explosion . treasure sank ship ... save , course , single piece sea glass . 
 Bombolini assumed dead , client furious , got paid . , duo successful heists . 
 “ die ? ” asked Fate . “ pretty sure died . ” 
 Bombolini tilted head , unable thanks wide setting predatory eyes — attempt valiant . “ look like dead ? ” 
 “ dunno , ” replied Graves . “ Maybe . ” 
 “ going kill , boss ? ” asked fishman impatiently , spotter resembling large , bipedal goby . 
 “ second Goby , ” said partner , hunched - humanoid pistol shrimp impressive long gun . “ said guys double - crossed , right ? deal ? ” 
 Bombolini blinked , walnut - sized brain chugging attempted remember exactly deal . decades , tends forget intricacies archnemeses .

 Graves followed Fate suite guts larger warehouse , stray bullet buried crate Goby Shrimp cover , fish - men froze . bullets whizzing air , Goby looked Shrimp , Shrimp looked Goby . felt like eternity passed . 
 “ think sa — ” said Goby , exploding . 
 blast rocked entire structure Fate Graves stumbled flimsy metal suspension bridge far crates black powder client originally described . 
 “ good , ” said Fate glance .

 “ happy , ! got ta ! ” exclaimed Fate armed mercenaries looked gloom , suddenly noticing distinctly non - fishlike criminals . 
 Graves , emotionally wounded wanted let , tossed smoke grenade catwalk , enveloping floor thick cloud caustic fog . “ usually fun , heart right , ” explained sound dry - heaving mercenaries . 
 “ big baby ? grown man ! ” shouted Fate , attempting action stray shots rang powder storage floor . 
 “ Stop calling big baby ! taking shots size . muscle saves day time goose cooked . ungrateful hell , Fate ! ” 
 “ ungrateful ? disappeared months fight Camavor ghost prince , rolled town night like owned place . ” 
 “ ghost king , lucky fought ghosts ! ghost , ghost . ghost ! ” 
 “ ! think read Shauna letters ? Graves , con man , trick . left outside scissors doll shirtless wonder saved day . ” 
 “ ai went , Fate , ” said Graves darkly . “ story . talk happened . ”

 “ fake fight having real fight ? real fight , punch stupid hat mouth . ” 
 “ think real fight ! know ? stink , think things , live grenades best ! ” 
 “ Yeah , , stopped working damn time ! think better , think better ! ”

 burning , rupturing warehouse , Bombolini surviving mercenaries poured service door catwalk , bolts decoupling walls combined weight . gunmen badly singed filled roiling anger fit match newfound crispiness . 
 “ fight later , dammit ! yer door ! ” Graves commanded Fate dropped argument run exit rapidly sinking catwalk buckling underfoot .

 “ Ugh , ” groaned Graves . “ sucked . ” 
 Fate fumbled head sure hat , confirmed safety hold screaming ribs . “ Yeah , . ” 
 “ Tobias , ... wanna thing . ” 
 “ , friend ? ” smiled Fate . 
 “ hope die , ” Graves cough - laughed . 
 “ Aw , shucks , sweet . ” 
 warehouse shook debris chunks roof smacked hard floor , smoke poured gaping second - story hole wall , flames licked tightly packed boxes hexplosives — emblazoned different frowning cartoon man process blowing . 
 “ notice wildly unsafe ? ” asked Graves , hobbling appeared service exit . 
 “ Bilgewater , Malcolm . notices . ” 
 “ ... ! ” said familiar , slightly raspier , voice . 
 Bombolini , sporting thick purple bruise center torso , stepped theatrically duo , harpoon gun primed large , sharky shape stood Bilgewater - noticed mercenaries way . Graves caught sight damp , shark - shaped spot dock outside . Bombolini likely hiding , waiting minutes reveal . 
 “ Gods , donut , ” Fate muttered . 
 “ , ! ” Bombolini exclaimed , stifling cough . “ know thought saw years ? time , — ” 
 “ interested , ” said Graves , pointing massive shotgun container explosives directly shark - man . Graves pulled trigger , gun fired , went smoke . 

 arm spans rupturing warehouse filled far explosives actually steal , Malcolm Graves Twisted Fate suddenly appeared air length half quaint little fishing pier ... residual smoke flame , Fate teleportation timing perfect . crashed ground Graves ’ gun landing squarely stomach . sound bit like “ uhbloof , ” number expletives . 
 “ blue cards sure useful , ” Fate bragged flat newly injured , dusting hat arm cradling possibly broken ribs . long day . 
 “ Yeah , useful beginning , ” wheezed Graves , little toasty bruised , worse wear . “ use gunfight breaks . stealing whatnot . ” 
 “ takes artistry . build sticking shadows — people ! ” Fate replied warehouse frame sagged distance flames erupted furiously - unexploded payloads . theatrically twirled hand bit , underline point . 
 “ Fair , ” said Graves , unconvinced . 
 pair sat blackened clothes , watching explode explode . romantic . considered sort thing romantic . , interestingly , . 
 “ , uh ... ? ” Fate said , breaking silence quickly possible . “ Double - cross dirty client ? Dig grave left Bombolini ? ” 
 Graves chuckled . “ Oh , definitely thing . tries blow blowing . Bombolini ... bet good money shark . like . dumb explode . ” 
 “ friend , brilliant dummy meet , ” smiled Fate . “ explode . mean sincerely . ” 
 “ Damn right , ” puffed Graves . “ , ... need conversation . ” 
 “ Right , ” Fate sighed . tired looking ways avoid apologizing , adrenaline feel better breaking cardinal rule reason . 
 word “ sorry , ” . bridge far . 
 “ Malcolm , mean imply better . dissolved business — ” 
 “ Stop , stop , stop , ” said Graves , laying shotgun dangled legs water . “ hate . Apology accepted — round . ” 
 “ Good man , ” replied Fate thankfully , gazing sea sun began set . 
 Graves looked partner add quip , noticed , time , certain angularity Tobias ’ features far failed appreciate . strong jaw , shockingly unbroken nose , bold choice semi - fashionable hats . objectively terrible person , maybe right kind terrible ... 
 Uh - oh , thought . 
 Malcolm Graves , older , somewhat wiser , infinitely worldly , measured words carefully things said given day . especially surprising , navigating complex relationship criminal masterminds strong suit , given thought . wondered ... worry Tobias ’ opinion ? like mattered . roles , , — 
 “ Malcolm , ” Fate interrupted . “ concussion ? ” 
 “ possible , ” Graves sighed , sad tired way . concussed way . 
 “ Alright , let look , ” said injured Fate , brushing Graves ’ hair aside looked signs bruise . “ know durable fella , invincible . ” 
 “ like Bombolini , ” said Graves , confused welling excitement Fate playing hair . 
 “ legitimately dumbfounded , ” Fate offered . “ remember boat heist . old friend caught middle deeply vicious detonation . ”

 “ Tried sacrifice , sure , cultist . whale guy . octopus guy . second whale guy . ” 
 “ Orca . ” 
 “ orca kind whale . monk . vastaya . Noxian . ” 
 Graves winced . “ Alright , bad . ” 
 “ Noxian , Malcolm . Noxus . People talked . ” 
 “ racist preferred man , hindsight , ” Graves allowed . “ ai like bringing home greatest lovers history . ai slick . ” 
 “ Excuse , slick , ” Fate protested . “ matter size , shape , , model , resist charms Tobias Felix . conned hundreds — nay , thousands — dew - eyed tourists vast gullible land . ” 
 “ , ” laughed Graves , little forcefully . “ , uh ... know . ” 
 “ Y ... yes , course , aware , ” Fate responded , making eye contact fiddled hat . 
 sat silence . relative silence , considering towering flames brutal detonations screaming shouting distance . 
 “ Sweet Tommy Kench , look sucker burn , ” said Graves , dangling legs pier like world grungiest adult child . “ Tobias , thinking . wrong , love crime , literally — ” 
 “ Shauna ? lady laughing jar ? ” asked Fate tinge poorly concealed jealousy , despite Graves having gay better decades . 
 “ Vayne , ” Graves corrected , deliberately necessary normal casual conversation platonic business associates , “ good friend . help killing monsters . love sacred , ‘ Shauna . ’ break neck looking . ... want deal right . ” 
 “ scary , ” said Fate . “ seen clothes like . hands . ” 
 “ scary , ” Graves agreed . “ afraid gon na kick wall . 
 “ Point , meeting new people . seeing world . Piltover . Shadow Isles . saw Camavor , Tobias . expanding horizons . want expand ‘ em . Hear Ixtal opening . good money ... know ... wanted come ride . ” 
 rustled coat , producing familiar blue playing card . “ case , probably need anymore . . ” 
 Fate chuckled . “ hold ? Think ... souvenir . ” 
 Graves grinned , slipping pocket . “ like sound . ” 
 partners smiled foolishly , imagining swashbuckling criminal misadventures sitting awkward physical distance apart . 
 “ , know , , uh ... partners , ” Graves specified . 
 “ Yes , obviously . Partners . crime , ” Fate added . 
 “ . ” 
 “ Nope . ” 
 “ Nada . ” 
 “ sir . ” 
 concluded exchange simultaneous fake cough . Graves looked unblinking water , Fate looked underside hat . Far distance , warehouse burned burned .

 Exhausted hunger gnawing belly , Sejuani swayed Bristle saddle , frozen hand tingling beneath furs . 
 Olaf kept pace foot , keeping counsel , mood dark . 
 Night closed reached foot mountains camped lee titanic menhir . great stone circle higher mountain , toppled long - ago earthquake . smooth stone surface carved ancient symbols read , pair frozen skeletons lay entwined far end , frosted blade lying bones . 
 Lovers bitter enemies , ? 
 Dawn brought fresh snows colder winds coming high peaks , mountain sought drive slopes . route home took past remains village stood road turned mountain pass . structures ghostly tombs , inhabitants dead long gone . 
 Nightfall second day saw come sight Winter Claw encampment . 
 guttering torches marked edge , Sejuani heart sank . long ago , marshaled followers , numbered thousands , hunger harshness recent seasons forced scatter host .

 “ Ach , mind , ” said Olaf . “ time blood - mist takes hope time . finally die glory . time fades , sad know step closer dying peace . ” 
 Sejuani shrugged . “ fear , Olaf . enemies , promise days blood battle , nights death fury . ”

Circling firepit , cloak raven feathers glistening orange light flames , told assembled claw - leaders coming winter grimmest known . 
 Olaf openly mocked man , telling child thing . 
 hunting claws met little success — Svalyek claw taken elnuk Avarosan drover waited long lead herd greener pastures , Heffnar group found killed small pod horned seals trapped land ocean floes frozen edge land . 
 nearly , tribe bellies days . 
 Fear tribe blood run hot , shouting voices clamored know , planned people alive spring muster . Sejuani answer , angry voices echoed long night ill - formed thoughts survive .

 Heads nodded suggestion Hunt - leader Varruki explained barely food sustain hunters , frozen starved returned . 
 Quieter speakers said maybe disperse tribe , family making way wilds . Smaller groups easier feed …

 Winter Claw survive?Once , struck open defiance , question fair gathered tent knew . 
 people needed leader life death decisions fear , told assembled leaders answer dawn light clawed mountains .

 strokes grew harder thought Ashe betrayed turned Sejuani raid Ebrataal . moment Sejuani known sure chance Winter Claw making peace Avarosan . 
 Bristle grunted annoyance , stamping hoofs irritation . 
 “ Careful , lass , beast getting unsettled , ” said voice . 
 Sejuani spun , reaching knife hip . 
 shape lay corner corral , small useless looking , like bundle rags . 
 released grip knife , shocked spoken . 
 Lying makeshift bed straw wretched old man left ice die years ago . legs stumps ended knee , sightless eyes mottled white like gull egg . 
 Kriek seer Olgavanna tribe , farmers builders refused Sejuani banner . sent Urkath war - claw wipe herds , furs , iron , salt . survivors fled slopes mountain summit seethed red rock flows . 
 Urkath returned , Kriek confused Sejuani demanded know brought useless mouth feed . Urkath claimed Ursine driven mountain , speaking blade - pierced titans draped bloodied fur horns , gaping skulls , fists hurled fire . 
 simply said mountain told bring blind man , dumping unceremoniously edge village . Sejuani given orders feed seer , left Freljord . , months leagues battle , alive , confusingly , Winter Claw . 
 “ Word glimpsed realm Lost Ones mountain , ” said Kriek . “ envy , lass . saw , drove Hearth - Home . ” 
 Sejuani aside irritation long , “ . blind . ”

 Sejuani tapped flat blade Kriek neck said , “ lass slit throat right . ” 
 “ Ah , yes , right , lass , Warmother , ai ya ? remember time seer tries tell , ” laughed Kriek , waving filthy , gnawed hand . “ listen , know warriors lose hand leg’ll swear feel cold ‘ em ? eyes . more’n , more’n wished . Things gouge eyes knife y’saw half . ” 
 “ know things seen , ” said Sejuani . 
 “ right , ” said Kriek , leaning . “ night spirit walker offerings Lost Ones … sang oaths , burned wood death knot , offered weapons bone , ? Days blood battle , nights death fury ? ” 
 thinking slaughter city river filled Sejuani hunger raw meat , thirst marrow sucked splintered bone . 
 shook head free sensations said , “ alive ? told people feed , leave . ” 
  “ Old Ornn fed , ” said Kriek . “ Hearth - Home , killers came smoke . Lifted like babe nourished mouthful broth great cauldron . , yes ! ” 
 Sejuani sighed . Kriek clearly mad , irritated Winter Claw clearly feeding old fool going hungry . went rise , old man hand shot took wrist powerful grip . 
 “ honor , scrap food passed lips dead man brought mountain , ” said Kriek , lifeless white eyes boring right , stared , infinitely older wiser . “ took food . water , ! Ornn great cauldron seen ! company sups leaves unsatisfied . mouthful belly growl turn seasons ! ” 
 “ Ornn Cauldron ? ” scoffed Sejuani . “ legend . Wishful thinking . lost tales tell children . ” 
 “ d’you think tales come truth ! ” snapped Kriek . lifting furs covering body . “ look like wishful thinking ? ” 
 Sejuani let involuntary gasp sight Kriek torso , flesh ruddy pink , belly soft fat . Sejuani ivory pale , wrists slender , flesh pulled tight frame , pressing bones want meat fat fish . 
 “ … ? ” said Sejuani . 
 “ told ya , ” said Kriek . “ Great Cauldron Ornn . Lost Ones stole Hearth - Home spite sake .
